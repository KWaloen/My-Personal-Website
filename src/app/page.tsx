          I am proud to introduce my first original game, BugShooter ‚òù! This is a game written in Java using Swing in a period of 4 weeks as part of the Inf101 coursework. <br></br><br></br>
          Growing up, I played a lot of Flash games on Newgrounds.com and my favorite were top down zombie shooters, so I challenged myself to make one. Making this game was a fun, educational, and stressful experience that took a lot of banging my head on the problem but things turned out quite nicely. One day, it occurred to me that instead of a zombie shooter, a bug shooter game would be more appropriate to reflect my experience in making this game.

          I present to you, Rodent Reboot ‚òù!
          <br></br><br></br>
          This is a game written in Java using LibGDX using Agile techniques as part of Inf112 coursework.

          My role in this project was lead tester and developer. As a tester, my responsibilities were to ensure that we complied with minimum coverage (75%) and to carry out manual testing, otherwords play the game a lot!
          As a developer, my main responsibilities were code review and writing code. My biggest contribution was the implementation of the item system in which I used a Strategy Design Pattern to randomly spawn powerup items and carry out specific powerup effects that the player interacted with at designated item spawn points on the map.
