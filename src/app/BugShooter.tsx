          I am proud to introduce my first original game, BugShooter ‚òù! This is a game written in Java using Swing in a period of 4 weeks as part of the Inf101 coursework. <br></br><br></br>
          Growing up, I played a lot of Flash games on Newgrounds.com and my favorite were top down zombie shooters, so I challenged myself to make one. Making this game was a fun, educational, and stressful experience that took a lot of banging my head on the problem but things turned out quite nicely. One day, it occurred to me that instead of a zombie shooter, a bug shooter game would be more appropriate to reflect my experience in making this game.
